# mpiMarkDup

This software allows the sorting and the marking of duplicates reads for high-throughput sequencing data after alignment from [SAM files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/). `mpiMarkDup` relies on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to perform the parallelisation of the sorting processing over multiple cores and nodes of high performance computing clusters.
