version-1.0
    - mpiMarkDup: sorts SAM files and mark duplicates

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary releases

Release from the 25/10/2019 

1) Not a good idea to play with magic number bgzip complains. We came back to previous version

2) TODO: now the major bottleneck is the computation of the collision in perfect hash table.
		 we shall compute collision only one time according to the biggest chromosome to mark.

3) TODO: problem with the option -q > 0 (it works with -q 0)

Release from the 23/10/2019

1) Add the magic number at end of BGZF file. This way samtools doesn't complain.

example of usage with samtools
- samtools flagstat chr1.gz
- samtools view -f 1024 chr1.gz

Other tools shall complain (not tested).

Release from the 21/10/2019 

1) Review of the search of mates after the bruck exchange of inter-process reads.
     We now use the hash table to look for the corresponding pair of a read.


Release from the 02/07/2019 

1) Fix a bug when pairs overlap 2 ranks

2) Fix a memory leak

Release from the 01/07/2019

1) Fix memory leaks

2) Remove global variable COMM_WORLD

Release from the 27/06/2019

1) Fix a corner case. We check intra-node overlap before extra-node overlap in mpiSort.c.

2) Fix a bug in sortAnyDim.c

Release from the 19/06/2019

1) Fix a corner case

Release from the 13/06/2019

1) Replace All2all with a Bruck when exchange external frags

2) Change some types in readInfo and mateInfo structures

Release from the 23/05/2019

1) Fix issues with openssl 1.0.2k-fips.

Release from the 15/05/2019

1) Cleaning up the code.

Release from the 07/05/2019

1) Fix reproducibility issue with 1 cpu.

Release from the 06/05/2019

Release from the 08/04/2019

1) fix reproducibility issue but still have a corner case.

Release from the 31/03/2019

1) fix corner case when read distribution is unbalanced.

Release from the 28/03/2019

1) fix some integer conversion and prototype.
2) fix a corner case when a rank recieve no mate from other rank.

Release from the 22/03/2019

1) fix the coordinates overlapped between 2 ranks in case we are not power of 2 dimension (again it's better if you are in power of 2 dimension)
